% function dict_new = dictionary_update(x_im, dictionary_old, coef_vals,

% 
% Takes a gradient step with respect to the sparsity inducing energy
% function.
% 
% Inputs:
%   x_im        - Data samples over which to average the gradient step
%   dict_old    - The previous dictionary (used to infer the coefficients)
%   coef_vals   - The inferred coefficients for x_im using dict_old
%   step_s      - The step size to take in the gradient direction
%   opts        - Options for the particular problem (outlined in
%                 learn_dictionary.m)
%
% Outputs:
%   dict_new    - The new dictionary after the gradient step

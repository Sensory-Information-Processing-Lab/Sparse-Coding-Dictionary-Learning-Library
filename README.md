# Sparse-Coding-Dictionary-Learning-Library

Code to implement the sparse coding dictionary learning algorithm described in ["Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images"](https://www.nature.com/articles/381607a0) in Nature (1996) by Olshausen and Field. This codebase is a modern implementation of this algorithm, taking advantage of multicore architectures and efficient numerical methods for L1 minimization. Code by A. Charles.
